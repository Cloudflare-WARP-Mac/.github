## What is Cloudflare WARP?  

**Cloudflare WARP** is a **modern VPN alternative** built to make your internet faster, safer, and more private. Unlike traditional VPNs that route your traffic through third-party servers, WARP encrypts your connection using Cloudflare’s global network — ensuring security without slowing down browsing speeds.  

Powered by **1.1.1.1 DNS technology**, WARP helps protect your data from network snooping, ISP tracking, and malicious actors. It doesn’t log browsing activity or sell user data, focusing instead on performance and privacy. Its lightweight architecture ensures near-zero latency while maintaining high-level encryption for all traffic.  

Cloudflare WARP seamlessly integrates with macOS, providing one-click connectivity and automatic protection for Wi-Fi and mobile networks. The app can also switch between **WARP** and **WARP+**, the premium tier that routes traffic through Cloudflare’s optimized Argo network for even faster response times.  

Whether you’re browsing, gaming, or working remotely, Cloudflare WARP ensures your data remains secure and your connection optimized — without complex configuration or technical setup.
